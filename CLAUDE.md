# CLAUDE.md — misc.tutorials

`misc.tutorials` is an R package of **“normal” (post-infrastructure)
learnr tutorials**. It is governed by the base tutorial guide and adds
only what is specific to this package below.

## Base tutorial guide (read this first)

These tutorials inherit the **base tutorial guide** — the default
contract for authoring any normal data science tutorial in this
ecosystem, at `claude-md/tutorials/CLAUDE.md` in the
[PPBDS/ai-rules](https://github.com/PPBDS/ai-rules) repo (locally:
[`../ai-rules/claude-md/tutorials/CLAUDE.md`](https://ppbds.github.io/ai-rules/claude-md/tutorials/CLAUDE.md)).
**Read it before working on any tutorial here.** It is the source of
truth for everything common to all such tutorials:

- the AI-era philosophy — students create artifacts by prompting an AI
  agent, not by typing code into learnr exercise chunks;
- the workflow — student work lives in `analysis.qmd`; they render with
  `quarto render` in a bash terminal and view the result via **Live
  Server**;
- exercise rhythm, the `question_text()` question types, knowledge-drop
  discipline, CP/CR and `show_file()` evidence;
- `echo = FALSE`, test-chunk discipline, code-chunk labeling, the
  setup-chunk skeleton, data handling, and formatting conventions.

`misc.tutorials` is one of the packages the base guide governs by
default — it is **not** an exception (those are `vscode.tutorials` and
`tutorial.helpers`). In the base guide’s normal-vs-modeling split, every
tutorial here is a **normal** tutorial: we mostly don’t care which code
does what — we care about the output. The modeling tutorials
(code-visible, slow-down-and-look) live in `primer.tutorials`, tutorial
05 and higher.

**Precedence.** On workflow and shared conventions, the base guide wins.
On `misc.tutorials`-specific content this file wins. Any departure from
the base guide must be an **explicit, on-the-record override** stated
here — never a silent difference. (The base guide already carries the
*Choosing topics (misc.tutorials-specific)* section; this file does not
repeat it.)

**Override — explicit `data/` scaffold in the r4ds sequence.** The base
guide (§4, Introduction step 3) says to state the goal and confirm with
bash `ls`. The five `r4ds-*` tutorials instead spell out the commands —
[`getwd()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/getwd.html), `dir.create("data")`,
[`list.files()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.files.html) in the R
Terminal — because they sit earliest in the sequence and students should
see exactly what is happening. `r4ds-4` and `r4ds-5` add the transition
note: “We will soon stop giving you commands like these and just have AI
do it.” Every later tutorial (`census`, `baseball`, …) follows the base
guide’s goal-stated + bash-`ls` form.

**Override — no interpretation exercises.** The base guide (§4,
*Analysis path*) requires a dedicated interpretation exercise after each
significant visualization, asking students to write one or two sentences
about what the plot shows. `misc.tutorials` does **not** follow this
rule. The tutorials here are structured around AI-assisted artifact
creation; students steer the analysis and judge the output, but are not
asked to write prose interpretations in the QMD. Knowledge drops carry
the interpretive commentary instead. Do not add interpretation exercises
to any tutorial in this package.

## What this package is

A collection of tutorials covering material from two companion texts:

- **[R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)** — the `r4ds-1`
  … `r4ds-5` tutorials.
- **[Analyzing US Census Data](https://walker-data.com/census-r/)** by
  Kyle Walker — the `census` tutorial.

**The organizing theme is storage technology.** Each tutorial sources
its data from a different sort of storage — delimited files,
spreadsheets, databases, Arrow files, spatial formats, and web APIs —
and then works with that data using the
**[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)**. The storage technology is
the spine of each tutorial; the subject-area domain (music,
births/basketball, baby names/flights, crypto/prediction markets,
wildfires/film rankings, census demographics) is chosen to suit it.

The division of the R for Data Science material into five tutorials
(`r4ds-1` … `r4ds-5`) is reasonable but **arbitrary** — the same
material could be split into more or fewer. Treat the count as a
convenience, not a fixed boundary, when deciding whether to split a long
tutorial (see `TODO.txt` on `r4ds-4`) or merge two short ones.

## Per-tutorial map

| Tutorial | Storage technology | Key packages | Data |
|----|----|----|----|
| `r4ds-1` | Delimited files (CSV) | readr, maps | `music.csv` |
| `r4ds-2` | Spreadsheets | readxl | `us_births_1994_2014.xlsx`, `nba_recruits.xlsx` |
| `r4ds-3` | Databases | DBI, dbplyr, duckdb, nycflights13, babynames | `*.duckdb` |
| `r4ds-4` | Arrow / Parquet | arrow, viridis | `*.parquet` |
| `r4ds-5` | Spatial / web | jsonlite, leaflet, purrr, httr2, rvest | `wildfires.geojson`, `imdb_snapshots.rds` |
| `census` | Web API | tidycensus, sf | `*.rds` |
| `baseball` | R data package (Lahman) | Lahman, tidyverse | [`Lahman::Teams`](http://cdalzell.github.io/Lahman/reference/Teams.md), [`Lahman::Batting`](http://cdalzell.github.io/Lahman/reference/Batting.md), [`Lahman::People`](http://cdalzell.github.io/Lahman/reference/People.md) |

## Project tutorials (`baseball` and later)

`baseball` is the first of a newer tier of tutorials (topics like
baseball, stocks, Bitcoin, weather, US maps) whose distinguishing
feature is that **the final artifact is a *project* — not a single
published `analysis.qmd` page.** A “project” is any multi-file Quarto/R
artifact a student creates and publishes: a simple multi-page
**website** (baseball’s form), but equally a **Shiny app**, a **Quarto
dashboard**, or similar. Students are assumed to have done the
`vscode.tutorials` material for whichever project type a tutorial uses,
so the project *mechanics* are not re-taught. The following base-guide
defaults are written for the single-page model and are **overridden on
the record** for this tier (the first three are general to every project
type; the fourth is specific to the website form `baseball` uses):

- **A project, not `analysis.qmd`.** The student builds a multi-file
  project with its own config (e.g. `_quarto.yml`) and a natural place
  for each topic, rather than one evolving `analysis.qmd`. The base
  guide’s “one evolving working chunk per topic” maps onto “one unit of
  the project per topic” — for a website, **one page per topic**
  (`home-runs.qmd`, `sluggers.qmd`); for a dashboard, one card/section;
  for Shiny, one view. Site/app-wide settings like
  `execute: echo: false` go in the project config once, not in each
  file’s YAML.
- **Students write AI-drafted prose as project content.** The TODO asks
  that students add text to the project; they draft framing/landing
  prose with AI and submit it via `show_file()` on the relevant file.
  **This is not the forbidden interpretation exercise.** The
  *no-interpretation-exercises* override still holds: we never ask a
  student to write graded prose explaining what a plot shows. Writing
  the project’s framing copy is **artifact-content creation** — words
  the project genuinely needs — and our shown answer is a model
  paragraph of that copy. Keep prose tasks to framing, not per-plot
  interpretation.
- **Topic-driven, not a new storage technology.** Per the TODO
  (“tutorials now are about concepts, not books”), this tier is
  organized around a **domain plus its gold-standard R data
  infrastructure**, and need not introduce an unused storage technology.
  `baseball` does not: its “storage” is simply the **Lahman** R data
  package. The storage-spine framing in *What this package is* applies
  to the `r4ds-*`/`census` tutorials; for this tier the spine relaxes to
  “domain + canonical data source.” Still teach the data ecosystem in
  knowledge drops (for baseball: Lahman as the season-level gold
  standard, with Retrosheet/Statcast/**baseballr** as the finer-grained
  frontier).
- **Website form (baseball’s project type).** A Quarto *website*:
  `_quarto.yml` + `index.qmd` + one analysis page per topic. Render the
  whole site with bare `quarto render`; open `_site/index.html` with
  Live Server (output lives in `_site/`). `.gitignore` ignores
  `/_site/`, `/.quarto/`, `/*_files/`, and (after the caching arc)
  `/*_cache/`. A page’s `#| cache: true` chunk creates a top-level
  `<page>_cache/` directory — same caching arc as the base guide, on a
  per-page chunk. The Summary publishes the **whole project** with
  `quarto publish gh-pages` (no filename) and its final evidence is
  `show_file("index.qmd")`. Other project types will have their own
  analogous specifics (a dashboard’s `_quarto.yml` `format: dashboard`,
  a Shiny app’s `app.R`/`shinyapps.io` deploy); record them here as they
  are built.

## Choosing topics

This is `misc.tutorials`’ content model — how it picks each tutorial’s
subject. The base guide routes topic selection to each project; this is
the routed section. Other projects’ models differ (the Primer fixes its
topics as the four Cardinal Virtues), so this lives here, not in the
base guide.

Tutorials are organized around **storage technologies** (the spine — see
above) paired with prominent data sources and real data science domains:
US Census data, baseball, stock data, Bitcoin, and other subject areas
where students learn what analysts actually use. When adding a tutorial,
pick a storage technology not yet covered (or a meaningfully different
facet of one), choose a domain that suits it, and follow the base
guide’s structure.

Each tutorial should teach:

- The gold-standard data sources for that area.
- The main R packages, APIs, file formats, and vocabulary students
  should mention to AI.
- Common data patterns, data quality issues, and standard analytical
  questions in that domain.
- A reproducible workflow that ends with a small published Quarto
  artifact.

**Prefer datasets that hide a discoverable anomaly.** The best data here
is rich enough that a simple analysis looks fine but misses something,
leaves clues that something is off, and rewards a further step — usually
a plot — that reveals and then explains the mystery. The `r4ds-1`
Billboard data is the exemplar: only the time-series plot of each song’s
weekly ranking exposes the strange discontinuity around week 20.
Actively search for more datasets with this feature when choosing
topics; it generally means reaching for **richer / larger** datasets
rather than small, clean ones. (See the base guide’s *Analysis path* for
how to build the discovery into the exercise sequence. Other data
choices for these tutorials are still under discussion.)

## Data handling — package specifics

**A tutorial’s data lives in a `data/` directory inside that tutorial’s
own folder** — `inst/tutorials/<name>/data/<file>`, sitting next to
`tutorial.Rmd` and at the same level as the `images/` directory (if
there is one). This is now the **base-guide default** (§6, *Data
handling*); the rationale — the package’s own code becomes identical to
the student’s code — lives there. Every file-based tutorial has been
migrated to this layout; `inst/extdata/` and the old re-download
machinery are **gone**. This section records the
`misc.tutorials`-specific mechanics:

- **The package’s setup and test chunks read data with the exact
  relative path a student writes:** `read_csv("data/music.csv")`, not
  `../../extdata/r4ds-1/music.csv`. Both resolve to `data/<file>`
  because a tutorial knits with its own folder as the working directory,
  and the student’s `analysis.qmd` sits in a repo with its own `data/`.
  Our answer chunks and the student’s prompts now match exactly.
- **Student-facing download URLs point at the same in-tutorial location
  on GitHub:**
  `.../raw/refs/heads/main/inst/tutorials/<name>/data/<file>`. Students
  download into their own project’s `data/` directory and read
  `data/<file>`.
- **Each `data/` directory carries a `README.txt`** documenting the
  provenance of its files. These provenance notes are kept in the repo
  but **not installed** with the package: `.Rbuildignore` holds the rule
  `^inst/tutorials/[^/]+/data/README\.txt$`, which strips the READMEs
  from the build while the data files themselves still ship.
- **Download-instruction style depends on the tutorial’s place in the
  sequence** (per the base guide’s *Match the download instruction*
  rule). The five `r4ds-*` tutorials are a student’s first data-science
  tutorials, so they may hand students an explicit, working
  `download.file("<url>", "data/<file>")` command. The project-tier
  tutorials (`baseball`, `ducks`, `movies`, …) and `census` come later,
  so they just point students at the stable URL and let them choose how
  to fetch it
  ([`download.file()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/download.file.html) or
  AI).

New work should add data under `inst/tutorials/<name>/data/`, reference
it as `data/<file>`, point the student download URL at
`.../inst/tutorials/<name>/data/<file>`, and drop a provenance
`data/README.txt`.

**Consequence — CRAN.** Because the data now ships *inside*
`inst/tutorials/`, it cannot be stripped at build time the way
`inst/extdata/` was, so the package exceeds CRAN’s size limit and is
**not CRAN-distributable** — an accepted trade-off (see `TODO.txt`: *“we
can’t put the repo on CRAN. But who really cares?”*). The old
CRAN-stripping machinery (an `R/zzz.R` `data_manifest`/`.onAttach()`
re-download hook, an `inst/extdata/` rule in `.Rbuildignore`, and a
`test-data-urls.R` check) has been removed; `R/zzz.R` no longer exists
and `utils` was dropped from `DESCRIPTION` `Imports`.

**Exception — tutorials whose data is an R package.** When a tutorial’s
data ships *inside an R package* (e.g. `baseball` uses **Lahman**),
there is no file to host: students
[`install.packages()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html)
and [`library()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html) the package, and
the tutorial’s test chunks reference the package’s tables directly
(`Teams`, `Batting`, `People`). Such a tutorial has **no `data/`
directory, no download step, and no `R/zzz.R` manifest entry** — just
add the package to `DESCRIPTION` `Suggests`. This is more honest about
how analysts in that domain actually work (loading the canonical data
package) and is the default for the project tier where it applies.
(`baseball` already follows this, so it needs no migration.)

## CRAN / build size

The tutorial data files are large (duckdb, parquet, and geojson run into
multiple MB each; the package is ~48 MB on disk). Under the
`data/`-in-tutorial convention the package **ships its data and is not
CRAN-distributable** (see *Data handling* above) — a trade-off we accept
in exchange for the package’s code matching the student’s code. The old
CRAN-stripping machinery (the `.Rbuildignore` `extdata` rule and the
`R/zzz.R` re-download hook) has been removed entirely.

The test chunks that depend on data files `skip_on_cran()` (see
`tests/testthat/test-tutorials.R`); that stays regardless, since the
point is simply not to run heavy data code on CRAN’s checkers.

## DESCRIPTION

Per the base guide, every package
[`library()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)-ed in a tutorial must
be listed in `DESCRIPTION` (`Imports` or `Suggests`) or GitHub Actions
`R CMD check` fails. This package keeps only `tutorial.helpers` and
`utils` under `Imports`; every tutorial-specific package (arrow, DBI,
duckdb, readxl, sf, tidycensus, leaflet, plotly, …) lives under
`Suggests`. When a new tutorial adds a library, add it to `Suggests`.

## Checking

Standard base-guide checks apply
([`rmarkdown::render()`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/reference/render.html)
for a quick syntax pass, `devtools::check()` before any PR,
[`learnr::run_tutorial()`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/learnr/reference/run_tutorial.html)
for the student view). `devtools::check()` may report a size NOTE — see
*CRAN / build size* above.
